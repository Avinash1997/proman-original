    ## API of Board Management Services


    This specification describes the endpoints, request/response model of the Board Management API.
    This API provides REST resources to manage project boards of Proman application.


    The resources should only be used over HTTPS (SSL) and can be accessed via the following base URL:


    ```
      https://proman.io/api/v1/boards
    ```


    ## API usage guidelines


    This section describes general rules and guidelines for using REST based
    services offered by Proman.

      * All resources can only be accessed via HTTPS and a respective HTTP Basic Authentication header is also required.
      * Proman reserves the right to add new parameters without further notice (in request and response).
      * Proman reserves the right to add new error codes without further notice. Proman will thereby stick to the HTTP STATUS CODES as defined by W3C.
      * Proman reserves the right to enhance enumerations by new values.
      * Proman reserves the right to increase the "maxItem" settings of arrays without further notice.
      
    Each consumer needs to tolerant about changes to the API as much as possible ([see Tolerant Reader Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html))


    ## Business definitions

    Board Management APIs can only be called by authorized users who has rights with required permissions to manage boards. These APIs can be used to create new board,
    modify an existing board, map team to the board, add members (users) to the board, remove members (users) from the board, map workflow, mark board as completed, .
    The users once mapped to the board will have an access to board and tasks assigned to them.

      description: >
        Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves
        security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access
        to the bearer of this token.”

        The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The
        client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <token>

        ```

        Similarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).

        Read https://jwt.io/introduction/ for more information on JWT standard.
